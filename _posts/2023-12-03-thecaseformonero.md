To fully explore the case for Monero in our digital age, we need to begin with a brief history of Bitcoin and the implications of its’ invention. Bitcoin is attempting to solve some of the most significant problems of our day, but by exploring its similarities and differences with Monero, we will see there is an argument to be made that Monero is the superior technology as we move further into the information age. While the breakthroughs brought to us by Bitcoin are not to be discounted, it is becoming increasingly clear that there are real threats to preserving the original purpose of this revolutionary technology. The fundamental question of years to come may be this: what will be valued more – digital scarcity or digital privacy? Is it possible to achieve both?
