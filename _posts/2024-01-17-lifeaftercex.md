*Much like Monero gives users privacy by default today, the future could also be KYC-free by default.*

At some point along the way after Bitcoin’s miraculous inception, the teeth of regulatory capture began to turn their bureaucratic cogs. Today it is nearly impossible for an average person to easily acquire Bitcoin without going through the shaming data collection process related to Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) laws. Many subject themselves voluntarily to the photos and mass collection of personally identifiable information – it’s just the price to participate in the market, and after all, they have nothing to hide - for now. 

As digital currencies move into the future and traditional fiat currencies face growing socioeconomic headwinds, governments will only attempt to tighten controls further. Not allowing self-custody, prohibiting possession of certain assets, restricting on-ramps further, and enforcing exorbitant taxes on assets are all things easily done that can effect us all – not just those with “something to hide”. What is allowed today is not guaranteed to be allowed tomorrow. With political, social, environmental, and economic tensions reaching a more fevered pitch globally it easy to see states around the world trying to target specific groups or individuals with financial restriction and [de-banking] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De-banking). It is imperative as a community that we learn how to live outside the reach of such things. Remember the core spirit of Bitcoin’s creation – to create unstoppable peer to peer electronic cash independent of central control.

Given the glimmer of mainstream acceptance we now see with Bitcoin and stablecoins, it is hard to argue fiat on-ramps to cryptocurrency will be severed entirely. This is a good thing; so long as there is a point of entry into alternative currencies there are tools below that can help break the link between those initial transactions and the new Monero you own. Whether it is using swap services or even atomic swaps, you can expect solid privacy protection – and it’s not as hard as it may sound. There are some great solutions available today for swapping from Bitcoin to Monero privately for example. For arguably even better privacy protections, peer to peer exchanges (whether in person or online) are a great solution. All that to say – Monero does not need centralized exchanges to survive and thrive. 

Below are resources to explore for the post-centralized exchange world (not an exhaustive list). It is best to familiarize yourself now and become comfortable with these tools before the last exchange standing de-lists Monero. Lastly – some of these links have pages for donations to the maintainers/developers. Please consider supporting their efforts. 

###Swap Services: 
*Swap services offer near-instant exchanges from one cryptocurrency to another for a nominal fee. Some of these services depend on centralized exchanges for liquidity, so be cognizant of the exchanges or services used in the background.*

###Atomic Swaps: 
*Atomic swaps offer a similar experience to the swap services above, however there is no 3rd party trust required in the middle. The swap is handled strictly via a cryptographically secure transaction protocol requiring zero trust. Most work in this area is still under development.*
