I'm a privacy nerd with interests in reading, writing, and home mining. I think Monero has an important role to play in the digital era and this is a space for research and writing on that topic. Hopefully the content here is useful in some way to you. My goal is to update content here at least monthly. 

*Sine secretis nulla libertas.*

If you appreciate the content and would like to encourage me to keep exploring Monero related topics, please consider sending some piconeros here:
