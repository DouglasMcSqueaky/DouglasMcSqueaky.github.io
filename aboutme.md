I'm a privacy nerd with interests in reading, writing, and home mining. I think Monero has an important role to play in the digital era and this is a space for research and writing on that topic. Hopefully the content here is useful in some way to you. My goal is to update content here at least monthly. I do not use analytics on this site, so to let me know you're reading or to provide comments/feedback, please reach me on XMPP: squ3aky@disroot.org 

If you appreciate the content and would like to encourage me to keep exploring Monero related topics, please consider sending some piconeros here:
